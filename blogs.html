    <p>On <strong>19th Sept. 2018 </strong>, <a href="https://presidentofindia.nic.in/" target="_blank">President
        of India</a> promulgated an Ordinance -The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance
      2018- Prohibited triple talaq (talaq-e-biddat); make such talaq void and illegal; punishable by imprisonment for
      a term which may extent to three years or / fine; Muslim woman entitled for subsistence allowance, custody
      of minor children; Offence compoundable at instance of married woman with permission of Magistrate; No bail
      to accused without hearing Muslim woman. Complaint can be filed with Police Station.
    <p> On <strong>6th Sept. 2018</strong> <a href="https://www.sci.gov.in" target="_blank">Supreme Court of
        India</a>, regarding LGBT, in case <strong>Navtej Singh Vs. Union of India </strong> Writ Petition
      Criminal 76 of 2016 declared that insofar as Section 377 Indian Penal Code, criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults
      (i.e.persons above the age of 18 years who are competent to consent) in private, is violative of Articles 14,
      15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. reading down Section 377 is necessary to exclude consensual sexual
      relationships between adults, whether of the same sex or otherwise, in private, so as to remove the
      vagueness of the provision to the extent it is inconsistent with Part III of the Constitution. History
      owes an apology to the members of this community and their families, for the delay in providing redressal for the
      ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries. The members of this community were
      compelled to live a life full of fear of reprisal and persecution. This was on account of the ignorance of the majority
      to recognise that homosexuality is a completely natural condition, part of a range of human sexuality. The
      mis-application of this provision denied them the Fundamental Right to equality guaranteed by Article 14.
      It infringed the Fundamental Right to non-discrimination under Article 15, and the Fundamental Right to live
      a life of dignity and privacy guaranteed by Article. The LGBT persons deserve to live a life unshackled from
      the shadow of being ‘unapprehended felons’.</p>
    <p>On <strong> 12th Sept. 2017 </strong> <a href="https://www.sci.gov.in/" target="_blank">Supreme Court of
        India</a> in its judgement <strong>Amardeep Singh Vs. Harveen Singh</strong> Civil Appeal 11158 of 2017
      , held that waiting period of six months in Section 13 (B)(2) (Divorce by Mutual Consent) of Hindu Marriage
      Act 1955 was not mandatory and can be waived under certain circumstances. </p>
    <p>On <strong> 24th Aug. 2017 </strong> nine Judges Bench of <a href="https://www.sci.gov.in"
        target="_blank">Supreme Court of India</a> in case <strong>Justice K S Puttaswamy (Retd.) and others Vs.
        Union of India, </strong> Civil Writ 494 of 2014 held that right of privacy is protected as an
      interinsic part of the life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as part of freedoms guaranteed under Part III
      of Constitution of India subject to restrictions specified, relatable to that part.
